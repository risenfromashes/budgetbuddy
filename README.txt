BUDGETBUDDY - Local Budget Tracker & Expense Analyzer
======================================================

A simple command-line expense tracking application written in Java SE 17+.
Reads CSV expense data, performs analysis, and exports reports.

COMPILATION
-----------

From the project root directory, compile all Java files:

    javac -d out src/**/*.java

Note: On Windows, you may need to compile packages individually or use:
    javac -d out src/model/*.java src/util/*.java src/io/*.java src/service/*.java src/cli/*.java src/Main.java

RUNNING
-------

Run the application with:

    java -cp out Main

Or auto-load a CSV file on startup:

    java -cp out Main data/expenses.csv

SAMPLE COMMANDS
---------------

Once the application starts, you can use the following commands:

> load data/expenses.csv
Loads expense data from the specified CSV file.

> list
Displays all loaded expenses.

> summary month 2025-02
Shows total spending and category breakdown for February 2025.

> summary category 2025-03
Shows category totals for March 2025.

> summary category all
Shows category totals for all time.

> export txt out/report.txt
Exports a plain-text report with ASCII visualizations.

> export html out/report.html
Exports an HTML report with tables and bar charts.

> help
Shows available commands.

> exit
Exits the application.

CSV FORMAT
----------

The CSV file should have the following format:

    date;category;amount;notes

Example:
    2025-01-03;Food;520;Lunch at cafe
    2025-01-05;Transport;150;Uber

- Date format: YYYY-MM-DD
- Separator: semicolon (;) or comma (,)
- Amount: decimal number (e.g., 520 or 520.50)
- Notes: optional description

SAMPLE SESSION
--------------

$ javac -d out src/**/*.java
$ java -cp out Main data/expenses.csv

Starting BudgetBuddy...

  ...

> export txt out/report_feb.txt
Text report written to: out/report_feb.txt

> export html out/report_feb.html
HTML report written to: out/report_feb.html

> exit
Bye.

TESTING
-------

A simple test harness is provided in TestHarness.java to verify correct behavior:

    javac -d out src/**/*.java TestHarness.java
    java -cp out TestHarness

Or use the provided sample-run.sh script to generate sample reports automatically.

NOTES
-----

- This is a demonstration project for learning design patterns
- No external dependencies required (pure Java SE)
- Data is stored in memory only (not persisted)
- Reports are generated as static files
- Intentional code duplication exists for refactoring exercises

KNOWN ISSUES (INTENTIONAL)
---------------------------

The code contains several design issues that are intentionally left for
students to refactor as part of a software design assignment:

1. Multiple ExpenseRepository instances are created throughout the application
2. CsvLoader, Summarizer, and report writers are instantiated repeatedly
3. Date and number formatters are created separately in each writer class
4. Report writers (TxtReportWriter and HtmlReportWriter) have parallel structure
   with duplicated formatting methods (formatDate, formatMonth, formatAmount)
